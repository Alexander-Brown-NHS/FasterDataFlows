# FasterDataFlows

This is a quick high level implementation of the Faster Data Flows API submission.

It only covers a SQL Server database connection and also is NOT using best practice when it comes to credential storage. **Any production implementation
should adopt their locally secure methods of storing and passing sercrets.**
